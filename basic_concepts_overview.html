    <div class="body">
      <p class="p">This chapter provides you with a tour of the AutoPIPE interface,
and walks you through several of the most basic tasks from opening
a model and defining a new system to placing a few components. If
you are a new user, you should carefully review the discussions of
selecting points, specifying ranges, and inserting components.
Veteran users who are switching from DOS to the Windows edition of
AutoPIPE should also note that the new interface allows for many
tasks to be performed graphically rather than through a series of
keystrokes.</p>
      <p class="p">This chapter introduces you to the most basic AutoPIPE tasks,
including:</p>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Starting AutoPIPE</strong>: Double-click on the
AutoPIPE icon (or select it from a taskbar).</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Loading a system model</strong>: The first step in
every AutoPIPE session is either to define a new system model or
load an existing one.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Navigating the interface</strong>: This section covers
basic interface navigation techniques and introduces you to the
program interface and command techniques.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">AutoPIPE Modeling Concepts</strong>: When modeling in
AutoPIPE it is important to understand some of the concepts and
techniques the designers have built into the interface. This
section briefly describes modeling concepts and principles.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p">Each of these topics is covered briefly in this chapter. The
intention is to give you a general understanding of these concepts.
For more detailed information regarding a particular command or
activity, refer to the appropriate section of the <em class="ph i">AutoPIPE
help</em>. <em class="ph i">Chapter 3</em> of this Tutorial includes a
walk-through of AutoPIPE features for the novice user.</p>
