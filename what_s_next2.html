      <p class="p">In the next chapter you will begin the second of the two
tutorial models. The second tutorial demonstrates how to import
models and systems, how to copy multiple instances of a system into
a model, and reviews additional modeling techniques.</p>

      <p class="p">The second tutorial begins by importing an existing AutoPLANT
CAD model in PXF format into AutoPIPE. After the model is imported,
new components are added and the model is saved in AutoPIPE. The
exercises also cover the insertion of multiple copies of a frame
model in order to construct a pipe rack/vessel/piping interaction.
The Result Filter options are also discussed. Even if you do not
use the AutoPLANT plant design CAD system, this tutorial covers a
number of important AutoPIPE features and capabilities. While the
second tutorial does not assume you have completed Part I of this
manual, it is assumed that you are familiar with some of the terms
and concepts introduced previously.</p>
      <p class="p">In this Chapter you will begin the second tutorial. An AutoPLANT
PXF file will be imported into AutoPIPE for use in stress analysis.
After the model is imported, you will connect a new segment and add
a vessel to the system.</p>
