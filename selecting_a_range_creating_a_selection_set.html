Set)</h1>
      <div class="body">
        <p class="p">Selection of ranges is a powerful tool within AutoPIPE that
users should become familiar with. By graphically selecting ranges
of points, users can insert, modify, or delete components,
properties, loads, and other data across ranges of points with one
command or graphically select points to be included in the output
reports.</p>
        <p class="p">Also, selection of ranges is required in order to graphically
cut, copy, or paste.</p>
        <p class="p">There are several methods available to graphically select ranges
of points. By using the <em class="ph i">Select</em> tab or Input Grids, users
can select by a number of different criteria such as by segment,
point names, component type, pipe diameter and other parameters.
Another common method used to select a range is to click on the
first point in the range, press and hold the
<strong class="ph b">[Shift]</strong> key, then click on the last point in the
range. The selection set will highlight red. This is the same
technique used to select ranges in Word, Excel, and other popular
Windows programs.</p>
        <p class="p">To create a selection set that includes components that are not
part of a contiguous run, use the <strong class="ph b">[Ctrl]</strong> key as
follows: To add more components to this set, or delete points from
this set press and hold the <strong class="ph b">[Ctrl]</strong> key and select
additional elements. The <strong class="ph b">[Ctrl]</strong> selection method
allows you to select a set of components that are not continuous.
Alternatively, <strong class="ph b">Select &gt; Selection &gt; Point</strong>
can add or subtract from the selection set on a point by point
basis.</p>
        <p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Select &gt; Selection &gt; Range</strong> command,
another method of creating a selection set, allows the user to
input “From” and “To” points inside a
dialog.</p>
        <p class="p">In any Input Grid Tab, select a group of rows or cells (same
column) using <strong class="ph b">[Ctrl]</strong> or <strong class="ph b">[Shift]</strong>
keys will highlight the selected points in red on the graphic.
Note: The point symbol and names will be highlighted when selecting
from the Points or Pres/Temp/PipeID Tabs. These two tabs enable
selection of all points in the model. The Pres/Temp/PipeID Tab also
provides a range selection up to and including the bend near or far
points. All other grid Tabs will highlight the component symbol and
the thermal anchor movements tab will highlight the anchor symbol
on the graphic.</p>

        <p class="p" id="bookmark50__bookmark51">Creating a New Model</p>
        <p class="p">Chapters 3-6 in this Tutorial guide you through the creation of
a sample AutoPIPE model. After the model is created, you will learn
how to define loads, analyze the system, and produce output
reports.</p>
        <p class="p">In this chapter you will create the first tutorial model. Before
placing components in a model, you must define the associated
piping code, pressure and temperature loads, starting coordinates,
and other factors. These values are used after the model is
constructed in the analysis of stress, operating loads, code
compliance, etc. After the model properties are defined, you will
route two segments and experiment with AutoPIPE’s Undo and
Redo features.</p>
