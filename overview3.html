      <p class="p">AutoPIPE provides powerful analysis tools to help you analyze
the effects of different loads on your system. Analysis is a
three-step process: First, you must assign the loads in your
system. Secondly, you must perform the analysis and specify which
loads are to be considered during the analysis. The third step is
to review the results in order to determine compliance. This
chapter covers all three steps in the stress analysis process, as
well as the process of revising the model after the analysis in
order to satisfy code compliance.</p>
