      <p class="p">The intent of this document is to familiarize you with the
features and interface of AutoPIPE. It is not a comprehensive
User’s Guide or Command Reference. For a complete listing of
all AutoPIPE commands and features, as well as for a list of
reference topics and other useful information, refer to the
extensive help system that has been provided with your software.
Bentley Help has been designed to provide you access to a variety
of different types of help. The suggestions below will make the
help system more useful.</p>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">

          <strong class="ph b">Dialog and Context-sensitive Help</strong>: From within
a dialog, you have a variety of help available. When a field has
the focus, you can press the F1 key to obtain field-specific
information. You can also press the<img class="image" src="media/img(131).png">
key in the title bar of the dialog, then select any of the fields
in the dialog. This second method has the advantage of being able
to access help related to grayed-out (disabled) items.
Additionally, from within a dialog you can always press the Help
button to access overview information related to that dialog.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Help Topics</strong>: You can view a “book
layout” i.e. Contents of the help system at any time by
pressing</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p">the <strong class="ph b">Contents</strong> command from the <em class="ph i">Help</em>
tab.</p>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Index</strong>: An extensive index of help topics has
been provided. Press the <strong class="ph b">Help</strong> button on any dialog
or select the <strong class="ph b">Contents</strong> command from the
<em class="ph i">Help</em> tab, then click on the <em class="ph i">Index</em> tab and type in
a topic in the field provided. The index list will filter as you
type.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Search</strong>: A more thorough search for a specific
keyword or phrase may be performed from the <em class="ph i">Search</em> tab.
Click on the <strong class="ph b">Search</strong> tab, then enter the keyword or
phrase that you want to find and press <strong class="ph b">List
Topics</strong>. All topics within the help system that contain the
entered keyword or phrase will appear in the selection list. Select
the topic that you want to display, then press the
<strong class="ph b">Display</strong> button to view the topic. You can do a
fuzzy search by entering a value in the <em class="ph i">Search</em> field and
pressing the <strong class="ph b">List Topics</strong> button or you can perform
a literal search by typing the search value within quotation
marks.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Relationship between Toolbar Reference and Reference
Information</strong>: A link exists between many of the help topics
in the Toolbar Command Reference section and supplemental reference
information which explains code compliance calculations, available
component and material libraries, etc. After reviewing general help
for a particular topic, check if there are additional links
displayed at the bottom of the main topic window.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Related Topics</strong>: Some Help Topics are logically
linked. In these instances, pressing a <em class="ph i">Related Topics</em>
button will present a list of topics related to the open item.
Highlight a selection in this list to open a related topic.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Examples</strong>: An extensive workbook has been
provided which contains procedures for many common AutoPIPE tasks.
You can get to this area from the main help page, through the table
of contents, or by links provided within one of the topics
themselves.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Considerations and Notes</strong>: Some topics have
supplemental considerations and notes available. These features
explain additional design considerations and requirements of which
you should be aware.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Printing</strong>: It is very easy to produce hard
copies of help documentation. To print the current topic, simply
press <strong class="ph b">Print</strong> from the topic window. Bentley Help
will send the topic to the default Windows printer. To print a
range of topics, go the <em class="ph i">Contents</em> tab and highlight a
folder. A dialog <strong class="ph b">Print Topic</strong> will display on
screen with the options “Print the selected topic” or
“Print the selected heading and all sub-topics”.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Additional information on Help</strong>: For more
information on using Windows Help Systems, press F1 while in any
help topic. The Windows Help file is opened, which contains
specific information on maximizing the power of windows help
systems.</li>
