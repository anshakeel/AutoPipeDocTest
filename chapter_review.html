    <div class="body">
      <p class="p">In this chapter we introduced several modeling techniques which
were used in the construction of a model. Before continuing, please
review the following concepts, which were introduced in this
chapter.</p>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Piping Codes</strong>: Each model in AutoPIPE must be
associated with a specific Piping Code. AutoPIPE will automatically
generate component and material options during operation of the
program based on the selected piping code. The code is also used in
code compliance calculations.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Pipe Properties</strong>: Every object placed in a
model is associated with a particular set of pipe properties. These
properties are initially defined during the creation of a new
system, but can be modified at any point during the design
process.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <img class="image" src="media/img(24).jpg">
          <strong class="ph b">Bend Placement</strong>:
Bends require a unique placement procedure. First, the user
specifies a tangent intersection point (TIP). This is the location
where two perpendicular pipe runs would intersect, and does not
indicate an actual physical point on the bend itself. After the TIP
is specified, the user must specify the location of the next
component or point. The downstream/next point helps to orient the
elbow in three-dimensional space.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p">

        <img class="image" src="media/img(253).png">
 <strong class="ph b">Flange Insertion</strong>: Flanges may be inserted
on both sides of a component (i.e., a valve) with a single command.
Highlight the desired component, then select Insert &gt; Piping
Components &gt; Flange. After completing the dialog, flanges will
be placed on both sides of the selected component.</p>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">
          <img class="image" src="media/img(254).png">
          <strong class="ph b">Tee Insertion</strong>:
Like elbows, tees rely on the placement of a connecting component
in order to orient it properly. Before the branch can be oriented,
a run point or component must be routed off the branch end of the
tee. To route off a tee branch, select the arrow graphic associated
with the tee, then select the desired point or component placement
command.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Zoom Controls</strong>: AutoPIPE provides a variety of
commands for controlling the display of the model. The Zoom
controls are available in the View tab, and on a special set of
toolbar buttons. A zoom control panel appears on the bottom of the
application window, and the model is displayed as a wireframe. Use
the commands in the menu or toolbar, or interactively pan, zoom,
and rotate the model using the keyboard commands listed on the
control bar.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p">
        <img class="image" src="media/img(25).jpg">  <strong class="ph b">Converting a
Point</strong>: Intersecting points on pipe runs can be converted
to a bend or a tee. The process is to first route the pipe runs,
then select the intersection point and execute the appropriate
Modify &gt; Convert Point To command. Existing points can also be
converted to run points using the Modify &gt; Convert Point To &gt;
Run command.</p>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">
          <img class="image" src="media/img(255).png">
          <strong class="ph b">Intermediate
Points</strong>: Points can be added along an existing pipe run.
The process is to first select a starting point, then select Insert
&gt; Piping Components &gt; Run. When the Run Point dialog appears,
specify the desired quantity of intermediate points in the Generate
Points field. By default, the new point(s) will be equally spaced
between the active point and the next downstream point.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p">
        <img class="image" src="media/img(256).png">  <strong class="ph b">Renumbering
Points</strong>: When inserting new points along an existing run,
the point names will no</p>
      <p class="p">
        <img class="image" src="media/img(257).png">longer be numbered sequentially
along the segment (assuming the default naming scheme was
utilized). To correct this, use the Home &gt; Operations &gt;
Renumber commands.</p>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">
          <img class="image" src="media/img(26).jpg">
          <strong class="ph b">Copy/Pasting a
Range</strong>: Ranges of components can be copied and pasted to
facilitate the modeling process. First select the range, then
select Home &gt; Clipboard &gt; Copy. The selected range is copied
to the Windows clipboard. You can now select a point in the model
and paste the copied elements to a new location. AutoPIPE will
automatically assign unique point names to</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p">the copied component set.</p>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">
          <img class="image" src="media/img(258).png">
          <strong class="ph b">Moving/Stretching</strong>:
AutoPIPE allows you to easily re-position components in the model.
Select the range, then select Home &gt; Operations &gt;
Move/Stretch. Input the new coordinates in the dialog. The
cutlengths of components attached to the re-positioned range will
be updated automatically and all connections will remain
intact.</li>
