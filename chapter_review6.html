    <div class="body">
      <p class="p">In this chapter you learned how to create a frame structure and
import two instances of it into the piping model. Points were
generated along the piping line and a frame was inserted at these
points. Finally, the frames were connected to the piping system
using Guide supports.</p>
      <p class="p">Before continuing, review the following concepts/techniques that
were introduced in this chapter.</p>
      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">
          <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">

              <strong class="ph b">Constructing a
Frame</strong>: Use the Insert &gt; Structure &gt; Beam command to
define beams in a model. The <em class="ph i">Beam</em> dialog allows you to
specify the Table Name (i.e., W), Section ID (i.e., W8X18), and
Material ID (i.e., A36) associated with a beam member. After these
values are defined, subsequent instances of the <em class="ph i">Beam</em>
dialog will default to the same values. A frame is constructed of
several beams. The user specifies the From and To points, then
inputs offset distances from the previous point.</li>
            <li class="li">
              <strong class="ph b">Saving the Active Point</strong>: When a model is
saved, AutoPIPE remembers the active point. This is useful when
inserting the model because the saved active point on the model
becomes the default reference point for placement.</li>
            <li class="li">
              <strong class="ph b">Importing an AutoPIPE model</strong>: Models may be
inserted into a current system with the File &gt; Import/Export
&gt; Insert Model/AutoPIPE Model (*.dat) command. Using this
technique, you can create libraries of frequently used
configurations for insertion into new models. Models are inserted
with respect to a reference point, and can either be connected to
an existing point(s), or placed an offset distance from a selected
point(s). If no points are selected, the offset is assumed from the
origin.</li>
            <li class="li">
              <strong class="ph b">Connecting Frame to Pipe</strong>: When inserting a
frame, you can use the Point Properties information window to view
coordinate information about a selected point. Using this</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p">information, you can specify the coordinates required to either
connect to, or place a known distance from, a known point in the
piping system. In this chapter, we purposefully placed the frames
slightly below the piping line and then connected the frame to the
pipe using a support.</p>
