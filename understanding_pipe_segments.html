      <h1 class="title topictitle1" id="ariaid-title1">Understanding Pipe Segments</h1>
      <div class="body">
        <p class="p">Each piping system is divided into a number of segments. As an
example, the sample model shown below contains five segments
labeled A through E. Piping models are entered into the program,
segment by segment. They may be extended or modified at any time by
either adding more segments or changing existing ones. The segments
are labeled automatically (A through E in the example). If more
than twenty-six segments are entered, the additional ones are
labeled AA, AB, AC and so on.</p>
        <p class="p">Although most of the piping segment definition is handled
automatically with AutoPIPE, in some circumstances it is
advantageous to plan the model in advance and divide it into
logical “segments” before creating the system (see
‘Rules for defining Pipe Segments’). Typically, a
segment would begin and end at anchor points or a branch
connection. However, as shown in Figure 2-1 below, at point D02, a
pipeline may be divided into two or more contiguous segments.
Whenever a tee/branch is inserted, AutoPIPE automatically assigns a
new segment identifier. Each new segment begins with a different
alpha character, making it easier for node numbering and easier to
keep track of segments when reviewing input listings or output
results.</p>
        <p class="p">When defining a new system, AutoPIPE automatically displays the
first Segment screen (the first segment is segment A). In this
screen, the user must specify starting X, Y, Z coordinates of the
Segment and input a Pipe identifier name. A Pipe identifier is used
to assign properties. The Pipe identifier can be any name that the
user wishes to use. It is a good idea to choose a meaningful name
such as the first few letters of a line ID or something like
8”std (indicating 8” nominal diameter, standard
schedule wall thickness) to help you keep track of pipe properties
when reviewing the model.</p>
        <p class="p">These properties will be applied to all components attached to
that pipe identifier until otherwise specified by inputting a new
pipe identifier name in one of the component dialogue screens.
After inputting a new Pipe identifier name, the <em class="ph i">Pipe
properties</em> dialogue screen will automatically be displayed for
input. For example, if you define a Pipe identifier as a 4-inch
line, then all following components will default to those same
properties until the user types in a new Pipe identifier name on a
component dialogue. A segment can be made up of multiple pipe
identifiers.</p>
        <p class="p">Existing Pipe properties can be easily modified using either
<strong class="ph b">Modify &gt; Properties &gt; Pipe Properties</strong> (which
modifies that Pipe Identifier throughout the entire model, wherever
it was used) or by graphical selection of a range of points and
<strong class="ph b">Modify&gt; Properties &gt; Pipe Properties Over
Range</strong>.</p>
