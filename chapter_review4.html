      <p class="p">In this chapter you learned how to convert an AutoPLANT
97-generated PXF file to an AutoPIPE piping stress model. We used
this imported model as a starting point on which to attach new
components. Before we could do this, however, we converted a run
point on the imported model into a tee point. After specifying the
branch direction, we were able to route a new run point off the
branch and define the local flexbilities at the nozzle/vessel
connection.</p>
      <p class="p">Finally, we created a vessel using a new, disconnected segment
and defined unique pipe properties for the vessel. The vessel and
the piping line were then connected with a rigid element placed
between the two segments.</p>
      <p class="p">Before continuing, review the following concepts/techniques that
were introduced in this chapter:</p>

From this dialog, users can select the file type of the model to be
imported then double-click on the file. As part of the conversion
process, the user is required to specify certain properties of the
system such as the desired piping code and pressure and temperature
conditions.</p>

ï‚· <strong class="ph b">Converting a Run Point</strong>: Points can be
converted to new point types. In this chapter we selected an
existing run point in the imported model and converted it using the

              <strong class="ph b">Nozzle/Vessel Flexibility</strong>: To define the
flexibility of the nozzle connection, we create a nozzle
flexibility element with a length equivalent to the wall thickness
of the vessel. This was accomplished using the <strong class="ph b">Insert &gt;
Piping Components &gt; Nozzle</strong> command.</li>
            <li class="li">
              <strong class="ph b">Creating a New Disconnected Segment</strong>: A
pressure vessel was constructed by defining it as a new,
disconnected segment of pipe. We modeled this vessel as a large
diameter pipe. By assigning it a new Pipe Identifier name, we were
able to assign pipe properties unique to the vessel.</li>
            <li class="li">
              <strong class="ph b">Connecting Segments</strong>: In the last section of
this chapter we connected the vessel to a nozzle using a rigid
element. This was done so that the movement of the vessel due to
thermal loads is transferred directly to the nozzle at the vessel
surface.</li>
