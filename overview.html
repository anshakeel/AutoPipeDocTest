      <p class="p">Developed to meet the needs of companies involved in industrial
piping system design, AutoPIPE utilizes Windows-standard commands,
object oriented graphics technology, and CAD interfaces to enable
users to create, modify, and review piping and structural models
and their results quickly and easily.</p>
      <p class="p">A graphical representation of the model is displayed as it is
being developed, providing instant visual feedback. AutoPIPE
performs extensive error checking as the data is being entered and
alerts the user if the model does not comply with the regulatory
standards of piping design.</p>
      <p class="p">Using AutoPIPEâ€™s object oriented graphical select options,
users can insert, delete, or modify pipe properties, supports, or
offsets across an entire range of points with one command.
Graphical selection of ranges is also used for cut, copy, &amp;
paste operations.</p>
