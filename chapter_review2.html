        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Assigning Loads</strong>: There are different methods
for assigning loads depending on whether the load is being assigned
to a point or to an entire system. For example, in this chapter you
learned how to assign a Concentrated Force to a specific point in
the model using the Insert &gt; Xtra Data &gt; Concentrated Force
command. A thermal load was also applied to an anchor point by
inputting the load value inside the <em class="ph i">Anchor/NodeLink</em>
dialog. An earthquake load was assigned to the entire system by
selecting Loads &gt; Environmental &gt; Static Earthquake. From the
dialog, you may define the number of earthquake load cases and
input values as multiples of gravity.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Performing a Static Analysis</strong>: The Static
Analysis command analyzes the effects of different loads on your
system. A dialog is presented in which you may select which loads
to include in the analysis. Obviously, loads must be defined in the
model before they can be analyzed. To include a non-linear
analysis, ensure that the <em class="ph i">Gaps/Friction/Soil</em> option has
been enabled in the <em class="ph i">Static Load Cases</em> dialog. To re-run a
static analysis with the previous set of load options, use the
Analysis &gt; Analyze &gt; Static Analysis command. To run an
analysis with new options, use the Analysis &gt; Analyze &gt;
Static Analysis command.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Graphical Review of Code Stresses</strong>: After loads
have been assigned and a static analysis performed, you can review
the results of code stresses. Many of these commands are available
in the <em class="ph i">Result</em> tab. For example, select Result &gt;
Interactive &gt; Code Stresses to produce a color-coded plot of
stresses in the model. A legend will appear to the left of the
modeling area to help you to quickly identify areas of concern in
the system.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Displaying Load Combinations</strong>: The Home &gt;
Results &gt; Combinations command helps you to identify the loads
that have been defined in the system. Of particular note in this
dialog is the “<em class="ph i">Non- Code Comb.</em>” tab, which
lists user-defined non-code combinations. By default, AutoPIPE will
assume that you want to define these combination sets manually, as
different users and systems have different requirements.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">User Defined Load Combinations</strong>: Use the Result
&gt; Setup &gt; Combinations command to input “Non-Code
Comb.” combination sets. A dialog allows you to name the code
for identification in reports, and to assign multiple
Case/Combinations and associated Factors.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Interactive Review</strong>: A variety of graphical and
point information is available for reviewing code results. A
deflected shape plot of the model can be produced with the
Result/Displacement command. The Result/Force &amp; Moment command
helps to review the Forces and Moments loads associated with a
selected point.</li>
        <li class="li">
          <strong class="ph b">Design Changes</strong>: Use the Result &gt;
Interactive &gt; Code Stresses command to check the piping code
stress results. AutoPIPE will highlight high stress areas in red
that may be out of range. You can then make a design change, re-run
the Static Analysis command, and confirm the results using the
Result</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p">&gt; Interactive &gt; Code Stresses command again. This
technique allows you to quickly confirm the success/failure of a
design change implemented to satisfy code compliance
requirements.</p>

      <p class="p" id="bookmark96__bookmark97">Output Reports</p>
      <p class="p">In this chapter you will generate a report on the model
constructed in the previous chapters. Reports can be opened,
generated and viewed from within AutoPIPE, or directed to a
printer. In this example, we will specify the loads to be included,
and then review individual sections of the output results.</p>
