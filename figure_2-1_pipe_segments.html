            <em class="ph i">Rules for Defining Segments</em>
          </p>
          <p class="p">A number of rules govern the definition of piping segments; they
are listed as follows:</p>
          <ol class="ol">
            <li class="li">Each segment has a forward and backward direction and is
entered as a sequence of points. AutoPIPE automatically keeps track
of the local axis of the segment, making it convenient to insert
intermediate points or components using the Length field. These
points are automatically assigned alphanumeric names (which the
user can override), with a maximum of four characters each. For
example, in Figure 2-1, segment B is defined by points A03, B01,
B02, B03, B04, and B05, all of which have default names. The
default increment in point names is 1. This increment can be
changed under <strong class="ph b">Tools &gt; Model Options &gt; Edit
Options</strong>. AutoPIPE can automatically renumber point names
after editing.</li>
            <li class="li">Wind loads and Hydrotest can be turned on and off on a segment
by segment basis, so keep that in mind when creating your model.
Also, AutoPIPE provides options to view the model, graphically
select, delete, or view output results on a segment by segment
basis.</li>
            <li class="li">Global coordinates must be entered for the first point of the
first segment (default global coordinates of Segment A is 0,0,0).
AutoPIPE automatically displays the first segment screen for the
user. This is point A00 in the example. Then, each point along the
segment is typically located by offsets from the preceding point,
until the whole segment has been defined (e.g. points A00 to A06
for segment A).</li>
            <li class="li">Subsequent segments typically begin at points which have been
defined previously (point A03 in segment B is an example). These
points are either branch points or continuation points (see #6
below). Since these points have already been defined, entering
coordinate data for them is not necessary.</li>
            <li class="li">Although Subsequent segments typically begin or end at an
existing point, this is not necessary for the program to function
correctly. It is often more convenient to start a disconnected
segment in space using <strong class="ph b">Insert &gt; Piping Components &gt;
Segment</strong> or clicking on the Segment, typing in the name of
the first point (in this case, make sure that the name of the first
point on the segment is not the name of a previously defined
point), and assigning the starting X,Y,Z coordinates of that new
Segment. For example, it may be more convenient to define suction
and discharge sections as disconnected segments without having to
model the equipment (see Pump Modeling Example in AutoPIPE on-line
help). Also, the ability to handle disconnected segments is a big
advantage when importing sections from a CAD model.</li>
            <li class="li">A continuation point is established when a new segment is
defined to begin at the end point of an existing segment (see point
D02 in Figure 2-1). This is typically done to divide a long length
of pipe into shorter segments or to turn on and off wind loads or
hydrotest on a segment by segment basis.</li>
            <li class="li">A tee branch connection point is any point which joins two or
more pipe segments, and requires a multiple pipe connection (see
points A03, and B05 in Figure 2-1) such as a tee or cross. A
continuation point can be made into a branch point using
<strong class="ph b">Modify &gt; Convert Point To &gt; Tee</strong>.</li>
            <li class="li">Cut and paste automatically creates a new segment.</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="p">When defining a segment, proceed from point to point along the
segment. Check that everything at the current point has been
specified before moving on to the next point.</p>
