      <p class="p">AutoPIPE is a stand-alone computer aided engineering (CAE)
program for calculation of piping stresses, flange analysis, pipe
support design, and equipment nozzle loading analysis under static
and dynamic loading conditions. In addition to 30 piping codes,
AutoPIPE incorporates ASME, European, British Standard, API, NEMA,
ANSI, ASCE, AISC, UBC, and WRC guidelines and design limits to
provide a comprehensive analysis of the entire system. AutoPIPE V8i
is available for Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 and can be
licensed across networks.</p>
      <p class="p">There are three editions of AutoPIPE: Standard, Advanced, and
Nuclear. The Advanced version offers several advanced analysis
capabilities not available in the standard version which are
detailed later in this chapter. The nuclear edition includes all
Advanced features, nuclear ASME in class 1,2,3, JSME PPC Nuclear
and thermal transient analysis. A KHK2 add-on option is also
available for the Advanced version that allows use of the Japanese
KHK Level 2 piping code in addition to all the features of the
Advanced version.</p>
      <p class="p">AutoPIPE is a proven, well-established program that has been
commercially available since 1986. AutoPIPEâ€™s rigorous
quality assurance practices have withstood numerous on-site audits,
making AutoPIPE one of the few PC based piping programs approved
for use in nuclear safety applications.</p>
